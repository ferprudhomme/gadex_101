    "text": "Nominations commence the gas flow in the pipeline. They encompass the request for the initiation of the transportation service. They specify the receipt and delivery locations for the request.\nThe receiving position is the point at which gas is transferred from the upstream pipeline to the carrying pipeline. The delivery site is the point when gas is transferred from the carrying pipeline to the downstream pipeline. Nominations encompass standard transportation, stipulations for supplementary fuel, and the notion of economic cycles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfirmations occur among linked pipes to guarantee that gas will be transported onto the pipeline and subsequently extracted in accordance with the shipper‚Äôs nomination. The verifying parties utilize the information supplied in the nomination to reconcile the transactions that traverse the interconnect.\nScheduling involves the pipeline operator assessing the available gas flow against the required gas flow and organizing the requests in accordance with pipeline limitations. Segmentation and flow-day redirection are also addressed in Scheduling.\n\n\nA Make-up is a mechanism in which shipper brings gas onto pipeline in case of ‚Äúimbalance due-pipeline‚Äù because shipper received more gas off of pipeline than it delivered onto pipeline."

    "text": "Flow Patterns and Infrastructure Usage\nOne of the most relevant patterns is the sustained shift in injection behavior at northern border points, particularly interconnections with Waha. The price spread between Waha and Henry Hub, along with dispatch conditions within the SISTRANGAS system, has directly influenced daily capacity allocation and infrastructure usage.\n\nüîπ Suggested Plot 1: Cross-border injection volumes (Waha, Agua Dulce, etc.)\nRoute Concentration and Operational Efficiency\nCENAGAS programming reports show an increasing concentration of flows along specific corridors, while other available routes exhibit repeated underutilization. When cross-referenced with regional demand levels and contracted capacities, the data points to a reallocation of supply routes with operational implications.\nüîπ Suggested Plot 3: Utilization rates by transport zone or route (stacked or line chart)\nRegulatory Adjustments\nUpdates to tariff schemes, access criteria, and permit issuance have introduced additional market-shaping variables. However, the evidence suggests that price signals and physical availability of capacity remain the primary drivers of system behavior.\nConclusion\nThe ongoing changes are better explained by structural conditions than by short-term or isolated events. Continued analysis of these variables is essential to anticipate operational risks, evaluate economic efficiency, and inform regulatory adjustments grounded in actual system performance."

    "title": "Firm Service Contract in SISTRANGAS",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A¬†firm service contract¬†in natural gas transportation is a binding agreement between a pipeline operator and a user (also known as a ‚Äúshipper‚Äù). When a contract is¬†firm, the operator is obligated to transport the shipper's gas up to a¬†Maximum Daily Quantity (MDQ), regardless of demand from other users. This guarantees that the shipper can move gas up to their contracted capacity‚Äîeven during system congestion‚Äîensuring¬†uninterrupted service.\nFirm service contracts also grant¬†priority access¬†in case of operational disruptions, giving these shippers an advantage over those with¬†interruptible service contracts. In essence, a firm contract secures¬†reserved pipeline capacity¬†with a high degree of reliability.\n\nOpen Access & Capacity Allocation in Mexico's SISTRANGAS\nIn Mexico, the¬†SISTRANGAS¬†(Integrated Natural Gas Transportation and Storage System), operated by¬†CENAGAS, has allowed shippers to reserve capacity since its first¬†open season¬†in 2017. During this process, each participating user was allocated an¬†MDQ‚Äîa contractual parameter measured in energy terms that, when managed effectively, ensures¬†flexible and continuous supply.\nAfter the initial capacity allocation, consumers had the option to:\n\nBecome direct SISTRANGAS users¬†(entering a contract with CENAGAS).\nTransfer their capacity to intermediaries¬†(gas marketers specializing in North America's complex supply logistics).\n\nRecently,¬†CENAGAS launched a contract renewal process, ensuring service continuity for existing users and consumers.¬†Learn more here.\n\n\nHow Shippers & Consumers Benefit\n\nShippers¬†can use their reserved capacity to¬†secure supply for their own needs¬†or to serve their clients.\nConsumers¬†(whether or not they act as shippers) can¬†switch suppliers freely¬†under Mexico's¬†unbundled market structure, preventing them from being captive to a single pipeline owner.\n\nThanks to¬†open access, firm contracts, and post-2017 renewals, end-users‚Äîhistorically dependent on¬†PEMEX's monopoly‚Äînow have direct or indirect access to pipeline routes.\n\n\nKey Details on Contract Renewals\n\nThe renewal process¬†only extends or terminates¬†existing contracts‚Äîno changes¬†will be made to:\n\nReserved capacity (MDQ)\nPrimary injection/withdrawal points\n\nHowever, the current¬†capacity allocation structure warrants review.\n\n\n\nWho Holds the Capacity? A Snapshot\n\n30 total users¬†(mostly gas marketers supplying multiple clients across SISTRANGAS).\nPEMEX Transformaci√≥n Industrial (PTRI)¬†remains the¬†dominant shipper, despite market liberalization.\nSome large consumers (e.g.,¬†Braskem Idesa) manage their own transportation contracts.\n\n\n\nRegionalization & Contract Distribution\n\nSISTRANGAS can be divided into¬†tariff zones¬†(based on 2015 classifications).\nEach shipper's¬†injection/withdrawal nodes¬†indicate their market reach.\n45 active contracts¬†(color-coded below), mostly held by¬†PEMEX and CFE.\n\n\n\nContracted Capacities: Who Leads?\n\nThe largest firm capacity (6.8 Bcf/day total) is held under¬†contract SBF/002/16‚Äîbelonging to¬†PEMEX TRI.\nOnly¬†6.3 Bcf/day¬†was allocated via open season, suggesting¬†CENAGAS has awarded additional firm capacity outside standard procedures.\n\n\n\nContract Expirations: What's Next?\nMost active contracts¬†expire by mid-2023, with very few long-term agreements in place. This raises questions about¬†future capacity allocation strategies.\n\n\nFinal Insight\nWhile Mexico's gas market has progressed since 2014,¬†PEMEX still dominates. The renewal process will shape whether new players gain more influence‚Äîor if legacy shippers maintain control."
