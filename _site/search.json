    "text": "Nominations commence the gas flow in the pipeline. They encompass the request for the initiation of the transportation service. They specify the receipt and delivery locations for the request.\nThe receiving position is the point at which gas is transferred from the upstream pipeline to the carrying pipeline. The delivery site is the point when gas is transferred from the carrying pipeline to the downstream pipeline. Nominations encompass standard transportation, stipulations for supplementary fuel, and the notion of economic cycles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfirmations occur among linked pipes to guarantee that gas will be transported onto the pipeline and subsequently extracted in accordance with the shipper’s nomination. The verifying parties utilize the information supplied in the nomination to reconcile the transactions that traverse the interconnect.\nScheduling involves the pipeline operator assessing the available gas flow against the required gas flow and organizing the requests in accordance with pipeline limitations. Segmentation and flow-day redirection are also addressed in Scheduling.\n\n\nA Make-up is a mechanism in which shipper brings gas onto pipeline in case of “imbalance due-pipeline” because shipper received more gas off of pipeline than it delivered onto pipeline."

    "title": "Firm Service Contract in SISTRANGAS",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A firm service contract in natural gas transportation is a binding agreement between a pipeline operator and a user (also known as a “shipper”). When a contract is firm, the operator is obligated to transport the shipper's gas up to a Maximum Daily Quantity (MDQ), regardless of demand from other users. This guarantees that the shipper can move gas up to their contracted capacity—even during system congestion—ensuring uninterrupted service.\nFirm service contracts also grant priority access in case of operational disruptions, giving these shippers an advantage over those with interruptible service contracts. In essence, a firm contract secures reserved pipeline capacity with a high degree of reliability.\n\nOpen Access & Capacity Allocation in Mexico's SISTRANGAS\nIn Mexico, the SISTRANGAS (Integrated Natural Gas Transportation and Storage System), operated by CENAGAS, has allowed shippers to reserve capacity since its first open season in 2017. During this process, each participating user was allocated an MDQ—a contractual parameter measured in energy terms that, when managed effectively, ensures flexible and continuous supply.\nAfter the initial capacity allocation, consumers had the option to:\n\nBecome direct SISTRANGAS users (entering a contract with CENAGAS).\nTransfer their capacity to intermediaries (gas marketers specializing in North America's complex supply logistics).\n\nRecently, CENAGAS launched a contract renewal process, ensuring service continuity for existing users and consumers. Learn more here.\n\n\nHow Shippers & Consumers Benefit\n\nShippers can use their reserved capacity to secure supply for their own needs or to serve their clients.\nConsumers (whether or not they act as shippers) can switch suppliers freely under Mexico's unbundled market structure, preventing them from being captive to a single pipeline owner.\n\nThanks to open access, firm contracts, and post-2017 renewals, end-users—historically dependent on PEMEX's monopoly—now have direct or indirect access to pipeline routes.\n\n\nKey Details on Contract Renewals\n\nThe renewal process only extends or terminates existing contracts—no changes will be made to:\n\nReserved capacity (MDQ)\nPrimary injection/withdrawal points\n\nHowever, the current capacity allocation structure warrants review.\n\n\n\nWho Holds the Capacity? A Snapshot\n\n30 total users (mostly gas marketers supplying multiple clients across SISTRANGAS).\nPEMEX Transformación Industrial (PTRI) remains the dominant shipper, despite market liberalization.\nSome large consumers (e.g., Braskem Idesa) manage their own transportation contracts.\n\n\n\nRegionalization & Contract Distribution\n\nSISTRANGAS can be divided into tariff zones (based on 2015 classifications).\nEach shipper's injection/withdrawal nodes indicate their market reach.\n45 active contracts (color-coded below), mostly held by PEMEX and CFE.\n\n\n\nContracted Capacities: Who Leads?\n\nThe largest firm capacity (6.8 Bcf/day total) is held under contract SBF/002/16—belonging to PEMEX TRI.\nOnly 6.3 Bcf/day was allocated via open season, suggesting CENAGAS has awarded additional firm capacity outside standard procedures.\n\n\n\nContract Expirations: What's Next?\nMost active contracts expire by mid-2023, with very few long-term agreements in place. This raises questions about future capacity allocation strategies.\n\n\nFinal Insight\nWhile Mexico's gas market has progressed since 2014, PEMEX still dominates. The renewal process will shape whether new players gain more influence—or if legacy shippers maintain control."

    "text": "The Case of Nodes V025 (Cactus) and V061 (Ramones)\nThe chart below displays nominated energy flows (in TJ/day) at the injection point V025, broken down by commercial cycle, over the first half of 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNode V025 is the commercial injection point associated with the Cactus Gas Processing Complex (Complejo Procesador de Gas Cactus), Mexico’s largest and most critical gas processing facility. Located in Tabasco and operated by Pemex, the CACTUS plant processes significant volumes of wet gas from southeastern production fields, removing liquids and impurities before delivering dry natural gas into the national pipeline network. As such, V025 functions as a key upstream interface between field production and the SISTRANGAS. Given its strategic role, nomination patterns at V025 reflect both production performance and system-wide supply availability, making it one of the most important nodes for monitoring operational balance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNode V061 is the commercial injection point linked to Los Ramones Phase I, the starting segment of the Ramones pipeline system, Mexico’s most significant natural gas import and transport project. Located near Camargo, Tamaulipas, V061 receives large volumes of U.S. natural gas through the NET Mexico pipeline, which connects to the U.S. grid at the Eagle Ford shale region. As the primary northern injection hub into the SISTRANGAS, Node V061 plays a critical role in ensuring supply availability for central and southern Mexico. Its nomination activity reflects cross-border trade flows and serves as a key indicator of Mexico’s reliance on imported natural gas.\nThis information is central to how Mexico’s gas transmission system—managed by CENAGAS—ensures daily balance between supply and demand across its national pipeline network."

    "text": "Operational Significance of Nominated Flows\nThe plotted data show the nominated injection quantities at node V025 for each cycle. These values are crucial for assessing operational imbalances, which occur when actual injections deviate from system needs. Importantly:\n• Scheduled quantities represent flows that have been authorized by the operator (CENAGAS).\n• These flows must correspond to nominated deliveries downstream, or to previously settled imbalance transactions (e.g., paybacks or over-deliveries).\nIf such a correspondence is missing, the injection creates a new operational imbalance—effectively gas entering the system without a planned destination or contractual justification.\n\nManaging Imbalances\nTo manage these discrepancies, CENAGAS applies balancing mechanisms, which may include:\n• Tolerance bands (permissible deviation margins),\n• Make-up withdrawals (planned future compensations), and\n• Imbalance charges (financial penalties or incentives to restore balance).\nPersistent or large mismatches can jeopardize system reliability, affect pressure conditions, and trigger costly interventions."

    "text": "Conclusion\nMonitoring nominated flows across the NAESB commercial cycles—Timely, Evening, and Intraday 1–3—reveals important insights into how market participants respond to changing supply-demand dynamics throughout the gas day. In the plot, we observe that:\n• Most activity concentrates around the Timely and Evening cycles, reflecting proactive day-ahead planning.\n• Intraday nominations, while fewer, show the system’s flexibility to adapt to short-term fluctuations or unexpected events. These transactions are usually the prevailing operating signals.\nThese patterns are also behavioral indicators of how shippers manage uncertainty, respond to market signals, and engage with CENAGAS’s programming process.\nPersistent discrepancies between nomination cycles or sudden shifts in intraday flows may signal emerging imbalances, strategy changes, or downstream issues. Thus, the temporal structure of nominations—not just their volume—is a key diagnostic tool. By analyzing when and how nominations are submitted, system operators and analysts can assess the quality of scheduling behavior, detect stress points in the network, and improve the accuracy of flow forecasts and balancing actions.\nUnderstanding these scheduling patterns helps ensure that the gas system remains secure, predictable, and economically efficient, even in the face of operational variability.\n© 2025 GADEX Inteligencia en Energia S.C.\nAll rights reserved.
